# Dynamic Event Calendar

A modern, responsive, and interactive event calendar built with React.js. This web app allows users to manage events, navigate through months, and seamlessly drag-and-drop events across dates. It's designed to provide a simple and intuitive user experience, with advanced features like modal-based event management, export functionality, and month navigation.

## Features

  - **Delete Event**: Remove events from the selected day.
  - **Drag-and-Drop**: Move events across different days using drag-and-drop functionality.

- **Event Modal**:
  - When a date is clicked, a modal opens to display all events for that day.
  - Events can be added, deleted, and managed directly from the modal.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**:
  - Built with **React.js** for a responsive, component-based architecture.

  - **Drag-and-Drop**: Implemented using the `@dnd-kit/core` library, enabling smooth and intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.
  
- **Event Handling**:

  - The events can be added, deleted, and moved between days using functions provided via hooks.

- **Modal Management**:
  - The modal for event management is implemented using React's conditional rendering and `useRef` for detecting outside clicks to close the modal.
